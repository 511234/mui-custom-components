## MUI Custom UI Components

Designed to reduce redundancy & improve readability during frontend development using React.js and MUI. Can be easily
used along with react-hook-form.

### Installation

```
npm i @lulutheflaneur/mui-custom-components
```

### Story behind...

I was migrating a React.js, antd-based project to MUI. TreeView API is available in MUI but it seems impossible to be
used with Select / AutoComplete components for UI consistency. So, I tried writing a TreeSelect using MUI AutoComplete
and List components during my leisure time. ;)
